Research projects typically go through a number of stages: conception, proposal, 
planning, execution, publishing, preservation, etc. If you work with personal 
data, you should think about how you will protect those data throughout all 
those stages. To do so, the concepts of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default 
([art. 25](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-25-gdpr/){target="_blank"}) are 
important:

- **Privacy by Design** in research means that your project integrates personal 
data protection right from the beginning, all the way throughout the project, 
and even afterwards. It should not be an afterthought: Privacy by Design is a 
key feature of the project, permeating all phases of a research project.
- **Privacy by Default** in research means that any questions, tools, or methods 
you use in your research should process as little personal data as necessary by 
default, and that you share the personal data only with those who really need 
access.

To get proper support in designing your project, it is important to contact your 
[privacy officer](#support) early on, preferably already in the conception or design phase. The privacy 
officer will help you go through the different stages smoothly, and eventually 
save you time and effort. They can help you review and possibly adjust your 
plans, determine the appropriate protection measures, and determine whether you 
need to perform a more elaborate [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia).

::: fyi
The European Commission has created 
[this interactive decision aid](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/ethics-data-protection-decision-tree/index.html){target="_blank"} 
that can also help you think of all the necessary steps to design your project 
with personal data.

A privacy scan is an initial risk assessment that helps you delineate how you 
will handle and protect the personal data in your research project ("a Data 
Management Plan for personal data", also known as "pre-DPIA", "DPIA-light", or 
"privacy review"). It contains information on your 
[research question(s)](#purpose-limitation), which [personal data](#personal-data) 
you process and from which data subjects, how you use the personal data (e.g., 
will you [share](#data-sharing-collaboration) them) and which 
[protective measures](#design-strategies) you apply, your [legal basis](#legal-basis), 
how data subjects can exercise their [data subjects’ rights](#data-subject-rights), 
and a preliminary assessment of the [risks](#risk-assessment) for data subjects.

The purpose of a privacy scan is to: 

- Make a preliminary assessment of the risks of your project for data subjects.  
- Implement [Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default](#privacy-by-design) into 
your project. 
- Fulfil the principle of [Accountability](#accountability) by documenting your 
project. 
- Identify whether a full [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia) (DPIA) is needed. 

### When to use a privacy scan? {#privacy-scan-when}

Whenever you use personal data in your project, we recommend to complete a 
privacy scan in consultation with your [privacy officer](#support) 
to make sure your data are well protected throughout your project. As the 
privacy scan is a planning document, much like a 
[Data Management Plan](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/data-management-planning){target="_blank"}, 
it is preferable to fill it out as **early as possible before you start 
collecting data**, to prevent unforeseen or costly changes to the design of your 
research project.  

::::note
- Treat the privacy scan as a living document: update it if anything changes 
in your design.  
- Retain the privacy scan as long as you retain personal data.
::::

Note that there is some overlap in content with some Data Management Plans and 
research protocols (e.g., that of the CCMO). The privacy aspects in a privacy 
scan are just more extensive.

## Data Protection Impact Assessment {#dpia}

::::keywords
On this page: DPIA, GBEB, risk assessment, high risk, protection measures,
safeguards    
Date of last review: 2023-02-14
::::

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is an instrument to identify and 
mitigate privacy risks associated with processing personal data in a project. 
Whereas a [privacy scan](#privacy-scan) is recommended for all projects 
processing personal data, a DPIA is required by the GDPR if your processing of 
personal data poses a [high risk](#high-risk-processing) to the rights and 
freedoms of data subjects or others 
([art. 35](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). This can be the 
case, for example, when you process personal data from vulnerable groups such 
as children or patients, sensitive personal data, or a large amount of personal 
data (see also the [risk assessment chapter](#risk-assessment)).

A DPIA is very in-depth, and requires an official advice from the university’s 
[Data Protection Officer](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/data-protection-officer){target="_blank"} 
(DPO). We strongly recommend contacting your [privacy officer](#support) 
early on: they can best estimate whether a DPIA is necessary and to identify 
any approved DPIAs that may be useful for your project to reuse. And they have 
to be involved in performing the assessment anyway.

### The process of performing a DPIA {#dpia-process}

1. Contact your [privacy officer](#support) as early as possible to assess the 
necessity to carry out a DPIA. 
2. Work together with your privacy officer, and possible other stakeholders like 
security officers, to assess your [design](#privacy-by-design) and 
[risks](#risk-assessment) and complete the DPIA.
3. When finished, the DPIA will be sent to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) for 
advice. Their considerations will also need to be documented.
4. You may need to adjust your research design and update the DPIA accordingly.
5. In case of a negative DPO advice, you should ask your head of department or 
faculty dean for permission to go ahead with your project.
6. Regularly update the DPIA when there are changes in your research project.
7. Retain the DPIA for as long as you retain personal data.

:::

To incorporate the concepts of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default into 
your project, the approach of **privacy design strategies** 
([Hoepman, 2022](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/pds-booklet.pdf){target="_blank"}) 
offers a way to make the GDPR principles more concrete. Hoepman distinguishes 8 
strategies that you can apply to protect the personal data in your research: 
minimise, separate, abstract, hide, inform, control, enforce, and demonstrate. 
Below, we explain what these mean and how you can apply them. 

:::fyi
The GDPR does not prescribe *which* specific measures you should apply in your 
project, only that they should protect the personal data *effectively*. Which 
measures will be effective, will depend on your specific project, the risks for 
data subjects, and the current progress in technology (i.e. will the data be 
protected on the long haul?). So make sure that your protective measures are
up-to-date as well!

#### <img src="img/minimise.svg" alt="minimise icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Minimise 
Limit as much as possible the processing of personal data, for example by:

- Collecting as little data as possible to reach your research purpose.
- Collecting only personal data from the amount of individuals necessary.
- Preferably not using tools that automatically collect unnecessary personal 
data. If possible, prevent tools you do use from doing so (Privacy by Default).
For example, the survey tool Qualtrics can automatically register location data,
which can be turned off by using the
"[Anonymize Responses](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-options/survey-protection/#AnonymizingResponses){target="_blank"}" 
option.
- Removing personal data when you no longer need them. Remove them from 
repositories, data collection tools, sent emails, back-ups, etc. (see also the 
[Storage chapter](#data-storage)). Use directly identifying 
information only if you legitimately need them, for example to keep in touch
with data subjects or to answer your research question.
- [Pseudonymising or anonymising](#pseudonymisation-anonymisation) personal 
data as early as possible.
- Use portable storage media only temporarily.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/separate.svg" alt="separate icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Separate
Separate the processing of different types of personal data as much as possible, 
for example by:

- Storing directly identifying personal data (e.g., contact information) 
separately from the research data. Use identification keys to link both datasets, 
and store these keys also separately from the research data.
- Separating access to different types of personal data. For example, separate
who has access to contact information vs. to the research data.
- Applying [secure computation](#secure-computation) techniques, where 
the data remain at a central location and do not have to be moved for the analysis.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/abstract.svg" alt="abtract icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Abstract
Limit as much and as early on as possible the detail in which personal data 
are processed, for example by:

- [Pseudonymising or anonymising](#pseudonymisation-anonymisation) the data.
- Adding noise to the data, e.g., voice alteration in audio data.
- Summarising the data to simply describe general trends instead of individual 
data points.
- [Synthesising](#synthetic-data) the data, e.g., for sharing trends 
in the data without revealing individual data points.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/hide.svg" alt="hide icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Hide
Protect personal data, or make them unlinkable or unobservable. Make sure they 
do not become public or known. You can for example do so using a combination of:

- Using [encryption](#encryption), [hashing](#replacement) or 
[strong passwords](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/it-facilities/information-security/information-security-secure-access-choosing-a-secure-password){target="_blank"}
to protect data. Consider using a password manager to avoid losing access to the 
data.
- Using secure internet connections and encrypted transport protocols (such as 
TLS, SFTP, HTTPS, etc.). Do not connect to public WiFi on devices containing 
personal data.
- Applying privacy models like [Differential privacy](#differential-privacy),
where noise is added to individual data points to hide their true identity.
- Only providing access to people who really need it, and only for the necessary 
amount of time and with the necessary authorisations (e.g., read vs. write 
access; only the relevant selection of personal data, etc.). Remove 
authorisations when access is no longer required.
- Encrypting and regularly backing up data that are stored on portable storage media (note that portable storage media are not recommended for use as [long-term storage and back-up](#data-storage-where)).
- Keeping a clear desk policy: lock your screen and store paper behind lock and 
key when you leave your desk.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

#### <img src="img/info.svg" alt="inform icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Inform
Inform data subjects about the processing of their personal data in a timely 
and adequate manner, for example by:

- Providing information via an 
[information letter or privacy notice](#privacy-notices) on a project website.
- Providing verbal explanation before an interview. 
- Obtaining explicit consent via an informed consent procedure.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

### <img src="img/control.svg" alt="control icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Control
Give data subjects adequate control over the processing of their personal data, 
for example by:

- Specifying a procedure and responsible person in case data subjects want to 
exercise their [data subject rights](#data-subject-rights).
- Providing data subjects with a contact point (e.g., email address) for 
questions and exercising their data subject rights.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

### <img src="img/enforce.svg" alt="enforce icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Enforce
Commit to processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, and adequately 
enforce this, for example by:

- Using only [Utrecht University-approved tools](https://tools.uu.nl/){target="_blank"} 
to collect, [store](#data-storage), analyse and [share](#data-sharing-collaboration)
personal data. 
- Entering into [agreements](#agreements) with third parties if they 
are working with UU-controlled personal data. Such agreements will make sure 
everyone will treat the data up to UU-standards.
- Always keeping your software up-to-date and using a virus scanner on your devices. 
- Appointing someone responsible for regulating access to the data.
- Always reporting (suspicions of) 
[data breaches](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/what-is-a-personal-data-breach){target="_blank"}. 
At UU, contact the [Service Desk](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/what-do-i-have-to-do-if-there-is-a-personal-data-breach){target="_blank"}. 
- If needed, drawing up a privacy and/or security policy that specify roles and 
responsibilities and best practices on how personal data are handled throughout 
a project. 
- Using a Trusted Third Party when linking individual data from different 
sources together.

[Back to top](#data-oriented-strategies)

### <img src="img/demonstrate.svg" alt="demonstrate icon" style="height: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"> Demonstrate
Demonstrate you are processing personal data in a privacy-friendly way, for 
example by:

- Registering your research project in the UU processing register (once available).
- Performing a [Privacy Scan](#privacy-scan) and storing it alongside the personal data.
- Performing a [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia) (DPIA)</a> for 
projects that have a high privacy risk for the data subjects.
- Keeping information for data subjects and (signed) informed consent forms on 
file. This is not needed if you can fully anonymise the data: then you should 
delete the (signed) consent forms as well.

## Information to data subjects {#privacy-notices}

:::

**A privacy notice is any information given to data subjects about what is 
happening with their personal data. In research, a privacy notice is usually 
combined with general information about the research project and often with an 
informed consent form, to satisfy both privacy and ethical concerns. Generally, 
the aim of a privacy notice is to inform data subjects on how and why their 
data are being processed. Providing that information is the "cornerstone of 
data subjects' rights", as without it, data subjects cannot exercise their other 
privacy rights.**

### When to use a privacy notice?
Informing data subjects is always required, for **all [legal bases](#legal-basis)** 
(so not only when you use informed consent). Being properly informed is a data 
subject's right in itself ([art. 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/){target="_blank"}): 
it is necessary so that data subjects can exercise their [other rights](#data-subject-rights)
(e.g., right to be forgotten, right to object, etc.). 

You need to inform data subjects **before** you start collecting or otherwise
processing their personal data (so before the start of your research project). 
If you share personal data with an external party, you should inform data 
subjects at the latest when first sharing those data with that external party.

When you use personal data from another source, you have to inform your data 
subjects within a month after obtaining their data 
([art. 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), except if:

- they have already been properly informed elsewhere.
- this would involve a disproportionate effort (e.g., considering the amount of 
data subjects, how old the data are, and which protection measures have to be 
applied, [rec. 62](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-62/){target="_blank"}).
- this would seriously impair your processing purposes (e.g., if you cannot 
answer your research question anymore, 
[art. 14(5)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 

### Form of a privacy notice
::::fyi
The format of the privacy notice is crucial. Even if you include all 
necessary components in your privacy notice, it will **not be GDPR-compliant** 
if you fail to provide the information in an appropriate form, shape and time.
::::

The information you provide to data subjects should be:

- **Clear and understandable**<br>
A privacy notice is not a legal document, so do not write it like you would 
write a legal contract. The information should be understandable for data 
subjects and it should have a clear and concrete meaning. For example, avoid 
using words like "may", "some", "often" and write active and short sentences.
Tip: try these 
[writing tips](https://www.researchplatform-dorp.nl/wp-content/uploads/20220329-Handleiding-PIF-beperkte_gezondheidsvaardigheden.pdf){target="_blank"}, 
this [language tester](https://ishetb1.nl/){target="_blank"}, or use this 
[simplified information sheet](https://www.pharos.nl/kennisbank/eenvoudige-en-begrijpelijke-onderzoeksformulieren-patientinformatieformulier-pif/){target="_blank"}. Or take a look at some good 
examples in terms of [language](https://www.eur.nl/en/media/2022-12-221208a2b1toestemmingethiekalgemeenbelangprivacycasus){target="_blank"} and [formatting](https://www.eur.nl/en/media/2023-05-geanonimiseerd-1-informatie-vragenlijstonderzoek){target="_blank"} (all in Dutch). You can also use the privacy information summary sheet [linked below](#content-and-examples-of-privacy-notices).

- **Easily accessible**<br>
Data subjects should be able to find the information easily. For example, publish 
the privacy notice on your project website, give participants a copy, or provide 
a QR-code or short URL. Even if you cannot inform data subjects directly, you 
should make an effort to inform them and put the information somewhere they will 
likely come across (such as a website or on social media).

- **Via multiple channels (when appropriate)**<br>
Textual information sheets are by no means the only way to inform data subjects. 
If appropriate, you can provide the information via other channels too, e.g., 
oral statements, images 
([example](https://irenececile.com/project/stripverhaal-wetenschappelijk-medicijnonderzoek-voor-kinderen-informed-consent/){target="_blank"}), 
audio, video 
([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5aMCfqw1Lw){target="_blank"}), 
etc. For some data subjects, such other channels of informing can lead to a better 
understanding of your processing activities.

- **Layered (when appropriate)**<br>
To balance being complete with being understandable, you can layer the 
information you provide. For example, provide concise information up front and 
provide more detailed information elsewhere (e.g., via a link or dropdown menu).

If you are uncertain about the level of intelligibility and transparency of the 
information, you can test these, for example through user panels, readability 
testing, or by interactions with data subjects themselves (or their 
representatives).

## Processing register {#processing-register}

::::keywords
On this page: registry, processing activities, project register, administration
Date of last review: 2022-01-05
::::

Any EU-based organisation is required to keep a registry of processing 
activities from within their organisation 
([art. 30](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
If you are performing research with human subjects, the odds are that your 
research project will have to be registered in such a register as well. Such a
register should contain who are processing the personal data, for what purpose,
which personal data are processed, with whom the data are shared, and how the 
data will be protected.

Notably, the GDPR does not prescribe what such a register should look like 
exactly, and thus every institution has their own way in which the processing 
register is implemented and managed. Ask your local [privacy officer](#support) how your
institution registers research projects that process personal data.

:::note
At Utrecht University, a university-wide processing register is currently being
developed. For the time being, other administrative systems and documents such as
the Data Management Plan, the privacy scan, the DPIA and/or the ethical 
application may function as a processing register. Please ask your
[privacy officer](#support) for more information about how your faculty handles this.
