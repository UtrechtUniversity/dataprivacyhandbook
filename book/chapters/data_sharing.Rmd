This chapter addresses guidelines to take into account when you want to share 
personal data with collaborators outside of your own institution **during** 
your research project. For guidelines to share personal data after a research 
project, please refer to the chapter on [Data sharing for reuse](#data-sharing-reuse). 

To be able to share personal data with external collaborators, you should:  

<details open="true"><summary><b>1. Make sure you have a legal basis and 
inform data subjects</b></summary>
  <div><ul>
      <li>Make sure data subjects are well-informed about your intentions to 
      share the data with collaborators. Include information in your 
      [information to data subjects](#privacy-notices) on the identity of your 
      collaborators, which data are shared with them and why, how, and for how 
      long. Avoid using statements that preclude sharing such as "Your data 
      will not be shared with anyone else".</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a [legal basis](#legal-basis) to 
      share the data, e.g., informed consent or public interest. If you use 
      consent, make sure that data subjects are aware that they are also 
      providing consent to share their data with your collaborators.</li>
      <li>Inform data subjects timely - <b>before</b> you start processing 
      their data - and <b>proactively</b> - directly if possible.</li>
    </ul>

<div><ul>
      <li>[Assess the risks](#risk-assessment) of sharing the 
      data and the measures you will take to mitigate those in your

      This is especially important if you will share your data with 
      collaborators outside of the European Economic Area.</li>
      <li>Share only the data that the collaborator needs (data minimisation), 
      for example by deleting unnecessary data, pseudonymising the data, and 
      sharing only with those who need access to the data.</li>
      <li>Make sure data subjects can still exercise their 
      [data subjects' rights](#data-subject-rights). For example, 
      if a data subject withdraws their consent, not only you, but also your 
      collaborators will have to stop processing the data subject’s personal 
      data. It is important to make clear how you and them will do so.</li>
</ul></div>
</details>

<details><summary><b>3. Come to agreements with collaborators</b></summary>
<div>
  In order to protect the personal data effectively, it is important to 
  determine which role every collaborator has: 
  [controller or processor](#definitions)? And if there are 
  multiple controllers, are they separate or joint controllers? For example, 
  in many collaborative research projects (e.g., in consortia), there are 
  multiple controllers that collectively determine why (e.g., research 
  question) and how (e.g., methods) to process personal data. These parties 
  are then joint controllers, and agreements need to be made in a 
  [joint controllers agreement](#joint-controller-agreement).
  <br><br>
  In any collaboration in which data are shared, you need to 
  ([art. 26](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-26-gdpr/){target="_blank"}):
  <ul>
    <li>Come to a formal agreement on:
    <ul>
      <li>The role of each party in the research project</li>
      <li>Respective responsibilities in terms of data protection, such as 
      informing data subjects and handling requests relating to data subjects' 
      rights</li>
      <li>Who is the main point of contact for data subjects</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Communicate (the essence of) the agreement to data subjects.</li>
  </ul>
  Your [privacy officer](#support) can help you draw up a valid agreement.
 </div>
</details>

<details><summary><b>4. Pay special attention when sharing personal data outside the EU</b></summary>
<div>
  If you share personal data with international collaborators (for example, 
  with countries that have no 
  [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en){target="_blank"}), 
  you may need to take additional measures. Usually, these measures include 
  drawing up an agreement to make sure the other party is GDPR-compliant and 
  uses the necessary security measures (if you haven’t already done so). 
  Please refer to the page about [international transfers](#third-country-transfer)
  for more information, and contact your 
  [privacy officer](#support) to assist you with international transfers.
</div>
</details>

<details><summary><b>5. Use a secure way to share the data</b></summary>
<div><ul>
  <li><b>Granting access</b>: It is preferable to grant a user access 
          to an existing and safe infrastructure (e.g., add someone to a Yoda 
          group or OneDrive folder), rather than physically sending the data 
          elsewhere. This allows you to keep the data in one place, define 
          specific access rights (read/write), have users authenticate, and 
          easily revoke access to the data after your collaboration has ended. 
          It is also a good idea to take measures to prevent the data from 
          being copied elsewhere.</li><li><b>Transferring data</b>: When it is absolutely necessary to

## Third-country transfers {#third-country-transfer}

Date of last review: 2023-08-18
:::

When you want to share personal data with parties who are located outside of the
European Economic Area (EEA), you need to take extra steps to make sure that
the transfer is GDPR-compliant, such as:

- Assessing whether you can transfer the data at all using a 
[Data Transfer Impact Assessment](#dtia).
- Taking additional protective measures, such as 
[Standard Contractual Clauses](#scc).
- Explicitly [informing data subjects](#privacy-notices) about the (possible) 
third-country transfer.
- ... And possibly more.

### What is a third-country transfer? {#third-country-transfer-def}

In legal terms, a transfer exists when personal data controlled by one party 
are accessible to another, irrespective of whether the data are physically sent 
to that party. An international/third-country transfer exists when the party 
that can potentially gain access is based in a country outside the European 
Economic Area (EEA) which does not have an 
[adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en){target="_blank"}
from the European Commission. 

::::fyi
There is a third-country transfer if personal data are stored at the servers of
a non-EEA party, and when a cloud provider is used that has servers both in-
and outside of the EEA.

There is **no** third-country transfer in the following cases:

- Personal data are stored at the university premises in the EEA, and are 
accessed from outside of the EEA by a researcher from that EEA university - this 
is not a transfer, provided that safeguards are in place to prevent other parties 
from gaining access.
- The party with whom the data are shared is already subject to the GDPR
(e.g., the party is situated in Germany or Italy).
::: 

### When is a third-country transfer possible? {#third-country-transfer-when}

GDPR [Chapter V](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-5/){target="_blank"} specifies 
all conditions under which an international transfer is allowed. The flowchart 
below indicates conditions that are most likely to apply to scientific research. 
Note that the flowchart assumes that you have taken sufficient safeguards 
to protect the personal data. To determine the possibilities of sharing data 
internationally in your project, we strongly advise you to consult with your 
[privacy officer](#support). In some cases a 
[Data Transfer Impact Assessment](#dtia) may be required, which can take some 
effort.

<img src="img/international-data-transfer.png" alt="Flowchart about 
international data transfers. If you are transferring data to countries 
within the European Economic Area, no additional measures are required. If 
you however transfer data outside of the European Economic Area, we 
recommend to contact your faculty privacy officer to take the proper 
measures.">

## Data Transfer Impact Assessment {#dtia}

:::keywords
On this page: data transfer, third-country transfer, sharing outside EU, EEA, 
risk assessment    
Date of last review: 2023-02-14
:::

A Data Transfer Impact Assessment (DTIA) is a risk analysis that is needed when 
personal data are [transferred to third countries](#third-country-transfers). 
A DTIA is not an official GDPR document by itself, like the DPIA, but instead 
is **usually part of, or a supplement to, a [DPIA](#dpia)**.

### Goal and content of a DTA {#dtia-goal}

The goal of a DTIA is to:

- assess the risks of:
  - the data receiver not being able to provide the promised level of protection.
  - local regulations preventing the removal or returning of the personal data after use.
  - local authorities accessing the personal data (il)legitimately.
- determine the appropriate safeguards to protect the data during the transfer. 

### Content of a DTIA {#dtia-content}

The DTIA [should ideally contain](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/edpb_recommendations_202001vo.2.0_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf){target="_blank"}: 

1. the context of the data transfer (which data are transferred, how, where?)
2. under which safeguards ([art. 46](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-46-gdpr/){target="_blank"}) 
the data will be transferred (e.g., [Standard Contractual Clauses](#scc))
3. how effective the safeguards will be ([risk analysis](#risk-assessment))
4. which additional safeguards are needed to ensure a sufficient level of data protection 
5. a final decision on whether or not the data can be transferred

As this is a relatively new topic in data protection land, please contact your 
[privacy officer](#support) for assistance with a DTIA or for questions about 
third-country transfers .

**There are many types of agreements that can – and sometimes should – be set up 
during a research project. Which one you need depends on the purpose of transfer, 
where the data are transferred to, and the external party’s role in the research 
project. The flowchart below gives an indication which agreement should be used 
in which situation. Under the figure, you can also find a short explanation 
about each individual type of agreement.**

![Flowchart to choose the correct type of agreement in research. Firstly, you do not need an agreement if you are collaborating with someone within your own institution, or if you use software of which the use is already covered by an existing agreement. Secondly, you need a non-disclosure agreement if you collaborate with someone outside of your institution who processes data within your institutional hardware. Thirdly, you need a data processing agreement when you collaborate with someone who does not have their own processing purposes and is thus a processor. You also need a data processing agreement when you use software that processes personal data on your behalf. Fourthly, you need a data transfer agreement when you collaborate with someone who wants to use your data for their own purposes, or when you use software that processes personal data for their own purposes. Finally, you need a joint controllers agreement when you collaborate with an external institution or with a software provider who has an overlapping processing purpose, such as a shared research question.](img/agreements_flowchart.png "Flowchart to choose the correct type of agreement in research")

### How to set up an agreement? {#set-up-agreements}

In order to set up an agreement, you should always get in touch with your 
[Research Support Office (RSO) or privacy officer](#support) to get the ball rolling!

:::warning
- Any agreement should be signed by someone who is authorised/mandated to do so. 
Usually this is a research director or faculty dean, but rarely you yourself. 
The RSO can tell you who in your case is mandated to sign the agreement.
- An agreement is not a replacement for consent or any other 
[legal basis](#legal-basis). It is a safeguard to make sure all 
parties involved treat the data safely and in accordance with the GDPR.
:::

### Non-disclosure agreement {#nda}

A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), or Confidentiality agreement, is an agreement 
that makes sure that either the receiver of the data or both parties handle 
data with care. Often, an NDA is meant to make sure that the receiving party 
keeps the data they get access to safe and processes the data according to 
specific guidelines. In research, it is often used between university researchers 
and students who perform research on their behalf. In this case, it is sometimes 
necessary to use an NDA, because students are not (always) bound to 
confidentiality through a contract with the university, whereas the researchers 
are.

### Data processing agreement {#data-processing-agreement}

A data processing agreement (DPA) is mandatory when you transfer personal data 
to a third party who fulfills the role of a processor 
([art. 28(3)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
In other words: a person or organisation that processes personal data on your 
behalf, without having a say as to why or how the data are processed. Important 
components of a DPA are a description of the data that are being shared, why 
they are being shared, what the third party can or cannot do with them, for how 
long, and what happens in case of a personal data breach. For example, the third 
party cannot use the data for their own purposes and is required to keep the 
data safe and report any potential data breaches to you. 

A DPA is most often used when you use an application or tool that processes 
personal data. Examples of these are survey tools, analysis tools, transcription 
tools, documentation tools and data repositories. With many parties that offer 
such tools, there is already a processing agreement in place at the UU-level, 
and so they are already safe to use, see the 
[Tooladvisor](https://tools.uu.nl/){target="_blank"}.

### Data Transfer Agreement {#data-transfer-agreement}

A data transfer agreement (DTA) is advisable when you transfer data to a third 
party who will (re)use the data for their own purposes, without having an 
active role in your research project. It is used often when this third party is 
an external institution, but is also recommended when the third party is someone 
from within your own institution. A DTA is used to ensure that both parties are 
aware of their responsibilities and are bound to do what the agreement says. It 
contains a description of the personal data that are being shared, why they are 
being shared, under which legal basis, and how the data should be protected by 
each party.

A DTA can be used when (for example):

- you want to share personal data for reuse purposes with other researchers. 
This also requires adding statements on the terms of use, although these terms 
of use can also be separately registered in a [Data Use Agreement](#user-agreement).
- you are using a software tool, and the software provider wants to run 
analytics on the personal data you process in their tool. This makes the 
software provider a controller, with a separate purpose from your own (e.g., 
answering your research question). Note that you likely already have a 
[Data Processing Agreement](#data-processing-agreement) with the 
software provider, and thus a clause in that DPA can also suffice in such cases.

<a href="https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/data_transfer_agreement_youth_template.pdf" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><button type="button">Example Utrecht University</button></a>

### Joint controllers agreement {#joint-controller-agreement}

A joint controllers agreement is mandatory when you work together with another 
controller on the same personal data, and you have common purposes (why) and 
means (how) of processing. In a joint controllers agreement, the respective 
responsibilities of both (all) parties are formalised, e.g., who informs data 
subjects, who is the contact point for data subjects, and how are data kept 
secure ([art. 26](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-26-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
In research, this happens most often in a consortium, where multiple institutions
participate in a research project. Therefore, a joint controllers agreement is 
often part of the consortium agreement, in which also topics other than the 
processing of personal data are formalised (e.g., intellectual property rights, 
how data are shared, etc.).

<!-- This text on the DUA may be clarified -->
### Data Use Agreement {#user-agreement}
A data use agreement (DUA), or user agreement, is basically a custom license for 
your dataset. It specifies the terms and conditions under which the receiver of 
the data can (re)use the data and is therefore in many ways similar to a 
[Data Transfer Agreement](#data-transfer-agreement). For example, 
it may contain statements on what the receiver can do with the data, and how 
the original data owners should be attributed. It can also state that the 
receiver must comply with the GDPR and cannot try to reidentify data subjects. 
DUAs are often used in data repositories (e.g., custom terms of use in 
DataverseNL) or as part of a Data Transfer Agreement, and often (but not always) 
when an open license is not suitable (e.g., with personal data).

### Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers {#scc}

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs, 
[art. 46](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-46-gdpr/){target="_blank"}) are 
model clauses that have been 
[pre-approved" by the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){target="_blank"}
to include in agreements. They are specifically meant as a (sometimes necessary) 
safeguard when personal data are transferred to processors and controllers
outside of the EEA (i.e., [third-country transfers](#third-country-transfer)). 
This is because the SCCs contain (among others) a list of 
minimal necessary safeguards that the receiving party should implement to ensure 
that the personal data are properly protected. SCCs only have to be used in 
specific situations, and they should ideally be preceded by a 
[Data Transfer Impact Assessment](#dia) that identifies SCCs as an 
appropriate measure. Please contact your [privacy officer](#support)
if you have questions about them.

::::note
There are also SCCs for transfers to processors *within* the EEA 
([art. 28(7)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
These can be included in a 
[Data Processing Agreement](#data-processing-agreement). Because they
are standardised clauses, including these can make it easier to finalise a DPA.
