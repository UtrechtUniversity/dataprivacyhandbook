# Tools & Services {#tools-and-services}

There are many tools that you can use to work with personal data, such as tools
to collect, store, and analyse personal data, but also to deidentify, encrypt
and synthetise datasets. In this chapter, we provide resources to identify
the tool you are looking for.

In short:

- If you work at Utrecht University, you can use https://tools.uu.nl to find UU-approved tools.
- On [this webpage](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/privacy-engineering-tools/){target="_blank"},
you can find tools and packages to deidentify, encrypt, synthetise and otherwise
work with personal data.
- If you are in doubt whether you can use a specific tool, please contact your
[privacy officer, data manager or information security](#support) for help.

When you are using a tool that processes personal data, that tool should do so
in compliance with the GDPR. If you work at Utrecht University (UU), you can use 
https://tools.uu.nl to find: 

- tools that are safe to use in the [Tooladvisor](https://tools.uu.nl/tooladvisor){target="_blank"}. 
These include tools for data collection, file sharing, audio transcription, and more.
Most of the tools listed in the Tooladvisor are safe to use either because no (personal)
data are being used by the tool, data are processed at UU premises, or because 
of a [Data Processing Agreement](#data-processing-agreement) between 
UU and the supplier of the tool, in which the supplier agreed to 
sufficiently protect the data entered into their tool.
- all [storage facilities](https://tools.uu.nl/storagefinder/){target="_blank"} 
provided by UU.
- a selection of possible [data repositories](https://tools.uu.nl/repository-decision-tool/){target="_blank"}
to publish (meta)data in.

Additionally, you can find available software via 
[this intranet page](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/software-at-work-teaching-rooms-and-home){target="_blank"}

We are creating an overview of potential privacy-related tools for 
deidentifying data, creating synthetic data, and analysing data in secure 
environments in a GitHub repository.

**If your tool of choice is not listed in https://tools.uu.nl, but it does
process personal data, please contact the 
[IT servicedesk](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/information-and-technology-services-its/i-want-to/get-help-and-advice){target="_blank"}. 
They will help you assess whether a tool is safe to use.** 

If a tool is processing personal data, the following two aspects are important to consider:

### 1. Who is processing the personal data: arrange an agreement

When you use a third-party tool that processes personal data, the data are not 
under your (full) control. In this case, you must ensure the GDPR compliance of 
the tool provider using ([art.46](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-46-gdpr/){target="_blank"}):

- A [Data processing agreement](#data-processing-agreement) - 
when the provider processes (e.g., stores, analyses, collects) personal data 
within the European Economic Area (EEA) or a country with an 
[adequate level of data protection](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en){target="_blank"}.
- [Standard contractual clauses](#scc) (SCCs) - when personal data are processed 
by a supplier outside of the EEA without an adequate level of data protection. 
These make sure the provider will use sufficient measures to protect the personal 
data and enable data subjects to exercise their rights.
- [Explicit consent](#informed-consent-forms) of data subjects who have been 
informed on the risks involved - in the absence of an agreement. Please contact your 
[privacy officer](#support) if you are considering this option.

You can assume agreements are in place for the tools recommended by UU. 
If there is no agreement in place between UU and the tool provider, using 
this tool is **not allowed**, even if the provider is located within the EEA, 
has an adequate level of data protection, or has high security standards. The 
only exception is when data are always end-to-end encrypted, because then the 
tool provider cannot learn anything from the data.

### 2. Security level

The tool provider should employ good security practices, such as regular back-ups 
in distinct geographical areas (preferably in replication rather than on tape), 
regular integrity checks, encryption at rest, multi-factor authentication, etc. 
Most of these aspects will likely be covered in the agreement, and sometimes a
[data classification](#data-classification) will need to be performed. 
[Information security](#support) can help you determine all necessary security requirements.
