When you use personal data in your research project, you likely also need to 
analyse those data, often using a script of sorts. In this chapter, we discuss 
the following scenarios for analysing personal data: 

![](img/secure-computing.png "Graphical depiction of the three secure computation scenarios: data-to-code, code-to-data and federated analysis")

1. ["Regular" data analysis](#data-to-code) ("data-to-code"), where the data are 
brought to the "script" or analysis software in order to analyse them.
2. ["Code-to-data" scenario](#code-to-data), where a script or analysis software 
is run on the data, without moving the data elsewhere. 
3. [Federated analysis scenario](#federated-analysis), where a script or 
analysis software runs on multiple datasets that are in different locations, 
without moving those datasets elsewhere.

Additionally, we discuss relatively new 
[cryptographic techniques](#computational-cryptography) that can be used in 
securing the analysis of  personal or otherwise sensitive data.

#### Which scenario should I choose?

Which scenario is suitable to apply in your project depends on, among others: 

- Your dataset: does it contain personal data? How large is the dataset? Do you 
know the data structure and analysis method beforehand? 
- Which computing facility is most suitable: 
  - Local (e.g., laptop), on campus (e.g., cluster at Geosciences), from a 
  national trusted party (e.g., SURF), or external (e.g., Amazon, Microsoft)? 
  - Located in the Netherlands, Europe or in a non-EEA country? 
  - Small or large amount of computing power (CPUs/codes/threads or GPUs, memory 
  size, disk space, etc.)? 
- Which software you need to run on the data using the computer power, e.g., R, 
Python, SPSS, or any other scripting language. 
  - Does the software require root user access to install and/or configure? 
  - Does the software require paid licenses (e.g., MATLAB)? 
  - Can the software be installed in advance, or does it need to be updated 
  during analyses (e.g., with additional packages from a repository)? 
- Whether and with whom you are collaborating on your project. 

#### Tools and support {#computation-support}

We have created an [overview of secure computing software and services](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/privacy-engineering-tools/secure-computing/secure-computing-tools.html){target="_blank"}. 
Keep in mind that this is by no means a complete list! 

If you work at Utrecht University, you can ask the 
[Research engineering team](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/contact-us){target="_blank"} 
for help with choosing a suitable computing solution. If you have already 
chosen a solution, but are not sure whether it is safe to use, you can contact 
[Information Security or your privacy officer](#support) for help.

  <img src="img/data-to-code.png" title="Graphical depiction of the data-to-code 
  scenario: the data are brought to the code (e.g., by transferring them)" 
  style="width: 25%; max-width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;"/>
  <p>
    In this scenario, you transfer the data to a computing facility, and run an 
    analysis (script) on the data.
  <br>
  <br>
    In the most basic variant, this computing facility consists of your work 
    computer or faculty computing cluster, where you do not transfer the data 
    outside of your organisation for the analysis. In other cases, data need to 
    be transferred to a computing facility outside your organisation, such as 
    [high-performance clusters](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/tools-services/software-and-computing/high-performance-and-cloud-computing){target="_blank"} 
    from SURF, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.
  </p>
</div>

### When to use

If you have a relatively small dataset, the "data-to-code" scenario is the most 
common and flexible scenario: 

- It allows you to choose a computing facility that is best suited to your 
situation.  
- It allows you to interactively read, analyse, export and transport the data 
you want.  

Disadvantages of this approach can be: 

- When transferring the data to a computing facility, often new copies of the 
data are created, which can make it more difficult to keep track of different 
versions of the data. 
- Transferring data always comes with additional risks of a data breach. Besides 
protection during data storage, it is therefore crucial to also protect the data 
during the transfer to the computing facility, and when used at the computing 
facility itself.  
- The way the data are transferred to the computing facility is not always as 
straightforward, especially if you have a large dataset. 

### Implications for research

In this scenario, you need to make sure that: 

- You apply data minimisation, access control, and, if applicable, 
pseudonymisation and other protective measures to limit the amount of personal 
data that is transferred to the computing facility. 
- The data are also protected during the transfer to the computing facility 
(e.g., your work laptop or an external solution), for example through encryption. 

Additionally, if the computing facility is provided by an external processor 
(e.g., SURF, Amazon): 

- A [data processing agreement](#data-processing-agreement) with the provider of 
the computing facility is needed. If there is none, you cannot use the computing 
facility to analyse personal data. 
- The computing facility should be suitable (secure enough) for the 
[sensitivity level](#data-classification) of your (personal) data. For example, 
if your data are "critical" in terms of confidentiality, the computing facility 
should also have that "critical" classification.

### Examples 

- You use your facultyâ€™s high performance cluster to analyse a dataset that you 
collected at your organisation. 
- You use the High Performance Computing platform from SURF to analyse a large 
dataset that you collected at your organisation. In this case, a 
[data processing agreement](#data-processing-agreement) between your organisation 
and SURF is needed to make sure that your organisation remains in control of the 
personal data at SURF's servers.
- You use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to analyse a large dataset that you 
collected at your organisation. In this case, a 
[data processing agreement](#data-processing-agreement) between your organisation 
and AWS is even more important, because Amazon has servers that are located 
outside of the European Economic Area.

  <img src="img/code-to-data.png" title="Graphical depiction of the code-to-data
  scenario: the data are not transferred outside the organisation, and instead, 
  the code travels to the data" 
  style="width: 25%; max-width: 200px; margin-right: 10px;"/>
  <p>
    In this scenario, an analysis is run on data without transferring the data 
    outside of the organisation In many cases, only the results of the analysis 
    can be exported, and not the data. 
  </p>
</div>

We distinguish the following versions of this scenario: 

<details><summary><b>'Tinker' version: interaction with the data</b></summary>
<div>In the Tinker version, users can log in to the computing facility and directly 
interact with the data, but there may be technical limitations on the import and 
export of the data. Procedural limitations should be posed through 
[agreements](#agreements) with the user. This version can be implemented in 
multiple ways, such as: 
<ul>
  <li>Accessing and analysing locally stored data on premises. An example is 
  analysing highly sensitive data in a dedicated room without an internet 
  connection.</li>
  <li>Accessing locally stored data through 
  [remote desktop](https://manuals.uu.nl/en/manual/solisworkspace-faq/){target="_blank"}. 
  This usually does not impose technical limitations on what can be done with 
  the data.</li>
  <li>[Virtual Research Environments](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/tools-services/software-and-computing/virtual-research-environments){target="_blank"}
  (VREs) are temporary facilities where you can interactively perform 
  computations on data in the cloud. In this case, it is sometimes possible to 
  impose technical limitations on what can be done with the data (in which case 
  these are called 
  "[Trusted Research Environments](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/sdpw/trew.html){target="_blank"}"). 
  Examples of VREs are 
  [SURF Research Cloud](https://www.surf.nl/en/surf-research-cloud-collaboration-portal-for-research){target="_blank"} 
  and [anDREa](https://www.andrea-cloud.eu/){target="_blank"}.</li>
</ul>
</div></details>
<details><summary><b>'Blind' version: remote execution</b></summary>
<div>In the Blind version, users do not have access to the data 
at all, and only receive the results of an analysis, after reviews by the data 
owner(s) to ensure that the results do not contain sensitive details. In this 
case, a [synthetic dataset](#synthetic-data) can be provided to write and test 
the analysis script on, before it is run on the real dataset. This "blind" 
version could be run in a dedicated environment where researchers can upload 
their script, but can also be implemented manually, for example when a 
researcher sends a script by email to be run on a dataset, and receives the 
results back via email as well (i.e., this is possible when neither the script 
nor the results contain any sensitive details).
</div></details>

:::fyi
Both the Tinker and Blind versions of this code-to-data scenario 
are available as virtual research environments in the 
[Secure ANalysis Environment](https://www.surf.nl/en/themes/research-infrastructure/sane-secure-environment-for-analysing-sensitive-data){target="_blank"} (SANE). At Utrecht University, 
access to a SANE environment is arranged via the same way as when [requesting a 
regular VRE](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/tools/software-and-computing/virtual-research-environments){target="_blank"}.
:::

### When to use

Reasons to use this scenario include: 

- You want to retain control over the data, e.g., to prevent any unnecessary 
copies from being made (data sovereignty). 
- You do not want, or are not allowed to transfer the data, because they contain 
personal data or intellectual property. 
- The dataset is too large to transfer. 
- In the 'Blind' version: You want to be sure that the analysis results do not 
contain any sensitive details. 

### Implications for research 

Compared to the "[data-to-code](#data-to-code)" scenario, the code-to-data 
approach offers more control over the data, but often requires more, sometimes 
manual, work, such as: 

- Checking the credentials of a user: can they be trusted? An 
[agreement](#agreements) with the user may be desirable or even required. In 
SURF Research Cloud, credentials can be checked using 
[SURF Research Access Management](https://www.surf.nl/en/surf-research-access-management-easy-and-secure-access-to-research-services){target="_blank"}. 
- Preparing a protected computing environment that a user can use. 
- In the 'Blind' version:
  - Creating a [synthetic dataset](#synthetic-data). 
  - Reviewing the output of the script for sensitive elements. This requires 
  the right expertise. 
  - Reviewing whether the code that is run on the data is privacy-preserving. 
  This also requires the right expertise.

It is essential to have a well-described workflow to use this scenario, to 
ensure confidentiality of the personal data. Additionally, dedicated personnel 
may make the process easier and consistent. 

### Examples

- A research team needs to process a dataset containing health data to determine 
the number of Covid-19 patients at a certain hospital. The hospital providing 
this dataset does not allow transferring the dataset, but they do allow to run 
scripts on the dataset. To make that possible, the hospital provides a computing 
facility, owned by the hospital, to run scripts from research teams. In addition, 
for each result, the hospital staff inspects if it contains personal data, and 
if not, it will be passed onto the research team. Since a result like "100 
patients at this hospital have had Covid-19 in 2021" does not contain personal 
data, it can be safely passed to the research team.
- In the [data donation approach](#data-donation), the software 
[PORT](https://github.com/eyra/port){target="_blank"} can be run on data 
subjects' locally stored data, and only the results of that analysis can be 
shared with the researcher if allowed by the data subject. Note however that the 
sensitivity of the results fully depend on the analysis that was run. 

## Federated analysis {#federated-analysis}

<img src="img/federated-analysis.png" title="Graphical depiction of the federated
analysis scenario: code (e.g., a machine learning model) travels across local
datasets and compiles the results of running the code in a central server" 
height="100%"/>

Federated analysis is an extension to the [code-to-data](#code-to-data) scenario, 
where the data of interest are owned by multiple organisations. In this scenario, 
the data remain with multiple data providers, and the script "travels" across 
those data sources, combining the results in a central location, and only 
sharing the results of the analysis. If necessary, there are techniques to hide 
intermediate results (which could also reveal sensitive information). If the 
script in question is a machine learning model, then this technique is called 
"federated (machine) learning". You can learn more about federated analysis in 
[this article](https://foldercase.com/blog-federated-data-analysis-how-to-get-started.php){target="_blank"}.

### When to use

Federated analysis is useful when there are multiple data providers who do not 
allow transferring their data outside of the organisation, or whose data are 
simply too large to share.

### Implications for research 

- A prerequisite for analysing data in this way is often that the data at the 
different providers are similarly structured and use similar terminology (e.g., 
making sure that every party uses "male", "female", and "other" as levels for 
the variable Gender, instead of "girl" and "boy", or 0 and 1). 
- Federated analysis works best for "horizontally partitioned" datasets, where 
different organisations have the same (types of) information, but from different 
people. It is not well-suited for "vertically partitioned" datasets, where the 
different organisations have different (types of) information on the same people 
and thus want to link those different data sources. 
- Setting up the infrastructure for federated analysis is challenging and can 
take a large amount of time (software installation, access rights, linking 
datasets, etc.). It is wise to first investigate whether this option is indeed 
the most suitable for your project.

### Examples

- A research team needs access to various datasets containing health data to 
determine which factors contribute to health of Covid-19 patients at various 
hospitals. Each dataset contains health data from patients of the hospital where 
they are treated. Since each dataset contains sensitive personal data, it is not 
desirable to store these datasets in a central location to combine them. To be
able to answer the research question, one needs to access each dataset separately 
and combine the results of each dataset. To make this possible, each hospital 
provides a computing facility. The research team submits their script to each of 
the computing facilities, where it is run on the local dataset. After a check by 
each hospital's staff that the results do not contain any sensitive details, the 
results of the individual computations are combined centrally into one result. 
In the example, the result of the calculation at each hospital is a prediction 
model for Covid-19 patients, and the individual models are combined to create a 
more reliable prediction model. 
- Several university medical centres use the 
[Personal Health Train](https://pht.health-ri.nl/){target="_blank"} from 
Health-RI, which relies on the [vantage6](https://vantage6.ai/){target="_blank"} 
software. 
- [DataSHIELD](https://www.datashield.org/index.php/about){target="_blank"} is 
an infrastructure and a series of R packages that allows to co-analyse data 
hosted at different organisations. It requires harmonising the data at the 
different organisations and setting up the DataSHIELD infrastructure.

## Cryptographic techniques {#computational-cryptography}

:::keywords

computing, mpc, homomorphic encryption    
Date of last review: 2023-04-02
:::

Besides the scenarios described previously, there are also multiple cryptographic 
techniques that can be applied to protect sensitive data in the analysis phase. 
Here, we discuss secure multiparty computation, confidential computing, and 
homomorphic encryption.  

::::note
Although there is some overlap in functionality and purpose between these three techniques, they are generally still considered to be distinct and can be combined to enhance security. 
::::

::::warning
These cryptographic techniques are relatively new and are not available as 
distinct services (yet) for direct application in research. They are for now 
listed here for information purposes. 
::::

### Secure multiparty computation {#mpc}

Secure multiparty computation (also referred to as "MPC") is a set of 
cryptographic techniques that allows multiple parties to jointly perform analyses 
on distributed datasets, as if they had a shared database, and without revealing 
the underlying data to each other. Among those techniques are secure set 
intersection (securely investigating which elements multiple databases have in 
common), homomorphic encryption (see below), and others.  

#### When to use 

The benefits of MPC are that no raw data are shared between the parties, 
computations are guaranteed to perform correctly, and there is a degree of 
control on who receives the result of the computation (i.e., the results are 
not necessarily combined in a central location). MPC is therefore a good way of 
implementing Privacy by Design into your project when you work with personal 
data.  

Contrary to [federated analysis](#federated-analysis), MPC is suitable for 
linking "vertically partitioned" datasets, i.e., when different organisations 
have different (types of) information on the same people and thus want to link 
those different data sources. 
 

#### Implications for research 

- The computation in MPC is really joint: you need to have agreed on a specific 
analysis to be performed and what you will reveal as result of the computation. 
- There is no one-size-fits-all MPC solution: different use cases ask for 
different implementations of MPC.
- Additional computational resources are required to generate random secrets 
and distribute data over the multiple parties. 

#### Example 

- MPC was used by a medical insurance company and hospital to determine the 
effectiveness of a personal lifestyle app for diabetes. In this example, it was 
possible to calculate average medical cost for different patient groups, based 
on whether they used the app or not, without revealing patient information 
between the insurance company and the hospital. 
- You can find a simplified example on 
[jointly calculating average income here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/){target="_blank"}. 

You can find more information about secure multiparty computation on 
https://securecomputation.org/, in 
[this report](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:8002b966-7bba-427c-b343-56326c1a587b){target="_blank"}, 
and on the [website of TNO](https://mpc.tno.nl){target="_blank"}.

### Confidential computing 

Confidential computing is a technique that protects data in use through a 
(hardware-based) Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This environment makes 
sure that data within it are kept confidential (data confidentiality) and that 
both the data and the code running in the TEE cannot be modified or deleted 
(data and code integrity). The TEE uses embedded encryption keys and makes sure 
that the analysis stops running when malware or unauthorised access is detected. 
Moreover, data and code are even invisible to the operating system, cloud 
provider and any virtual machines. 

There are many possible applications of this technique, for example: 

- You want to protect against unauthorised access during the analysis of 
sensitive data. 
- You want to analyse sensitive data, and it is necessary to use an untrusted 
cloud platform or infrastructure. 
- You want to prevent the analysis script from leaking or manipulating data.  

It is important that confidential computing is used together with encryption of 
data at rest and in transit, with restricted access to the decryption keys. It 
also requires the TEE to be trustworthy (attestation), which is an active field 
of study. You can read more on the website of the 
[Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/){target="_blank"}. 

---

### (Fully) homomorphic encryption {#homomorphic-encryption}

Where "regular" [encryption](#encryption) focuses on data at rest (e.g., in 
storage) or data in transit (e.g., when transferring data), homomorphic 
encryption allows analyses to be performed on encrypted data ("data in use"). 
During the analysis, both the data and the computation result remain encrypted, 
unless they are decrypted by the decryption key owner. This technique can be 
applied both in [confidential computing](#confidential-computing) and in 
[secure multiparty computation](#mpc). 

There are multiple types of homomorphic encryption: partial, somewhat partial 
and fully homomorphic encryption. The latter is the most promising solution, as 
it allows an infinite number of additions and multiplications to be performed on 
the encrypted data.  

Currently, the practical use of homomorphic is limited, because it can require 
a lot of computational resources to use it, causing it to be relatively slow. 
New implementations are however being developed, see 
[this website](https://homomorphicencryption.org/introduction/){target="_blank"} 
for a list of available implementations. Another limitation is that there is no 
interaction with the data during the analysis, and so you cannot check whether 
the analysis was successful. To solve this, you could use a synthetic dataset 
to develop and test your algorithms first.
