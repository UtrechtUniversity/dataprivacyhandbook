![Illustrated cover image for the Data Privacy Handbook, showing a person sitting cross-legged with a laptop on their lap. From the laptop arise several concepts that are covered in the Data Privacy Handbook: Anonymisation (depicted as a face covered with a censor bar), Transparency (depicted as one person showing another person a checklist, informing them), Data sharing (depicted as two laptops connected to a globe), Privacy by Design (depicted as a map with a shield on it), and Personal data (depicted as a fingerprint that connects zeros and ones). The person is floating as if in meditation: happy that they achieved GDPR compliance. The left upper corner of the image shows the Utrecht University logo, and the bottom of the image says 'Data Privacy Handbook'.

## About

The Data Privacy Handbook is a practical guide on handling personal data in 
scientific research, primarily written for Utrecht University researchers and 
research support staff in the Netherlands. It is an initiative of 
[Research Data Management Support](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management){target="_blank"}, 
in collaboration with privacy and data experts at Utrecht University.

The Data Privacy Handbook consists of:

- A **knowledge base** which explains how the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming)  applies to 
scientific research, including guidelines and good practices in carrying out 
GDPR-compliant scientific research; 
- An overview of privacy-enhancing **techniques & tools** and practical guidance 
on their implementation;
- **Use Cases** in the form of research projects with privacy-related issues, 
for which a reusable solution (e.g., tool, workflow) is shared.

The content presented in the Data Privacy Handbook has been carefully curated by 
Research Data Management Support, in collaboration with privacy officers and

The Data Privacy Handbook is a 'living' book that is continually being written, 
updated and reviewed. Its contents can therefore change, or become outdated or 
redundant. Hence, the information presented is provided "as is", **without

As scientific research may differ depending on the discipline, topic, and 
context, measures needed or taken to ensure GDPR-compliance will vary across 
research projects. The authors can therefore **not be held responsible, nor 
accountable** for any negative consequences arising from interpretation and use 
of the content of the Data Privacy Handbook.

The Handbook does not necessarily
constitute a mandatory directive. **For the most up-to-date and official/

to which this Handbook is a hands-on, practical supplement**. Moreover, before 
implementing the guidance laid out in this Handbook, always seek the advice of 
your privacy officer or RDM Support to confirm the suitability of any proposed 
solution to your project.

As of February 2025, we use Matomo to track the usage of the (online version of the) Data Privacy Handbook. 
We do this, because we want to see how often the Data Privacy Handbook is being visited, how users find it, and which pages are most useful. 
When you click "OK" in the cookie banner, Matomo places an analytics cookie in your web browser. 
The following information is collected about you:

- Which pages you visit and for how long, and how long the page loads
- Generic aspects of your behaviour on the page (e.g., files downloaded and links clicked)
- How you found the page (e.g., directly or via another website)
- From what location you are accessing the page
- What language your browser is in
- How you are accessing the page (e.g., which device and browser)

1. Anonymized user IP address
2. Date and time of the request
3. Title of the page being viewed (Page Title)
4. URL of the page being viewed (Page URL)
5. URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page (Referrer URL)
6. Screen resolution being used
7. Time in local user’s timezone
8. Files that were clicked and downloaded (Download)
9. Links to an outside domain that were clicked (Outlink)
10. Pages generation time (the time it takes for webpages to be generated by the web server and then downloaded by the user: Page speed)
11. Location of the user: country, region, city, approximate latitude and longitude (Geolocation)
12. Main Language of the browser being used (Accept-Language header)
13. User Agent of the browser being used (User-Agent header)

We do not collect your detailed location, and use IP address "anonymisation" to prevent other unnecessary details from being collected. 
This ensures that we cannot directly lead your data back to you.

This information is stored for 1 year at a university server in the Netherlands. 
The analytics are only shared with the maintainers of the Data Privacy Handbook and communication professionals employed at Utrecht University. 
We do not share any analytics with external parties, and you are not tracked across websites.
