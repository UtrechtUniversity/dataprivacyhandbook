**A privacy notice is any information given to data subjects about what is 
happening with their personal data. In research, a privacy notice is usually 
combined with general information about the research project and often with an 
informed consent form, to satisfy both privacy and ethical concerns. Generally, 
the aim of a privacy notice is to inform data subjects on how and why their 
data are being processed. Providing that information is the "cornerstone of 
data subjects' rights", as without it, data subjects cannot exercise their other 
privacy rights.**

### When to use a privacy notice?
Informing data subjects is always required, for **all [legal bases](#legal-basis)** 
(so not only when you use informed consent). Being properly informed is a data 
subject's right in itself ([art. 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/){target="_blank"}): 
it is necessary so that data subjects can exercise their [other rights](#data-subject-rights)
(e.g., right to be forgotten, right to object, etc.). 

You need to inform data subjects **before** you start collecting or otherwise
processing their personal data (so before the start of your research project). 
If you share personal data with an external party, you should inform data 
subjects at the latest when first sharing those data with that external party.

When you use personal data from another source, you have to inform your data 
subjects within a month after obtaining their data 
([art. 14](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/){target="_blank"}), except if:

- they have already been properly informed elsewhere.
- this would involve a disproportionate effort (e.g., considering the amount of 
data subjects, how old the data are, and which protection measures have to be 
applied, [rec. 62](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-62/){target="_blank"}).
- this would seriously impair your processing purposes (e.g., if you cannot 
answer your research question anymore, 
[art. 14(5)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/){target="_blank"}).

### Form of a privacy notice
::::fyi
The format of the privacy notice is also crucial. Even if you include all 
necessary components in your privacy notice, it will **not be GDPR-compliant** 
if you fail to provide the information in an appropriate form, shape and time.
::::

The information you provide to data subjects should be:

- **Clear and understandable**<br>
A privacy notice is not a legal document, so do not write it like you would 
write a legal contract. The information should be understandable for data 
subjects and it should have a clear and concrete meaning. For example, avoid 
using words like "may", "some", "often" and write active and short sentences.
Tip: try these 
[writing tips](https://www.researchplatform-dorp.nl/wp-content/uploads/20220329-Handleiding-PIF-beperkte_gezondheidsvaardigheden.pdf){target="_blank"}, 
this [language tester](https://ishetb1.nl/){target="_blank"}, or use this 
[simplified information sheet](https://www.pharos.nl/kennisbank/eenvoudige-en-begrijpelijke-onderzoeksformulieren-patientinformatieformulier-pif/){target="_blank"}. Or take a look at some good 
examples in terms of [language](https://www.eur.nl/en/media/2022-12-221208a2b1toestemmingethiekalgemeenbelangprivacycasus){target="_blank"} and [formatting](https://www.eur.nl/en/media/2023-05-geanonimiseerd-1-informatie-vragenlijstonderzoek){target="_blank"} (all in Dutch).

- **Easily accessible**<br>
Data subjects should be able to find the information easily. For example, publish 
the privacy notice on your project website, give participants a copy, or provide 
a QR-code or short URL. Even if you cannot inform data subjects directly, you 
should make an effort to inform them and put the information somewhere they will 
likely come across (such as a website or on social media).

- **Via multiple channels (when appropriate)**<br>
Textual information sheets are by no means the only way to inform data subjects. 
If appropriate, you can provide the information via other channels too, e.g., 
oral statements, images 
([example](https://irenececile.com/project/stripverhaal-wetenschappelijk-medicijnonderzoek-voor-kinderen-informed-consent/){target="_blank"}), 
audio, video 
([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5aMCfqw1Lw){target="_blank"}), 
etc. For some data subjects, such other channels of informing can lead to a better 
understanding of your processing activities.

- **Layered (when appropriate)**<br>
To balance being complete with being understandable, you can layer the 
information you provide. For example, provide concise information up front and 
provide more detailed information elsewhere (e.g., via a link or dropdown menu).

If you are uncertain about the level of intelligibility and transparency of the 
information, you can test these, for example through user panels, readability 
testing, or by interactions with data subjects themselves (or their 
representatives).


## Privacy scan {#privacy-scan}

Date of last review: 2023-02-14
:::

A privacy scan is an initial risk assessment that helps you delineate how you 
will handle and protect the personal data in your research project ("a Data 
Management Plan for personal data", also known as "pre-DPIA", "DPIA-light", or 
"privacy review"). It contains information on your 
[research question(s)](#purpose-limitation), which [personal data](#personal-data) 
you process and from which data subjects, how you use the personal data (e.g., 
will you [share](#data-sharing-collaboration) them) and which 
[protective measures](#design-strategies) you apply, your [legal basis](#legal-basis), 
how data subjects can exercise their [data subjects’ rights](#data-subject-rights), 
and a preliminary assessment of the [risks](#risk-assessment) for data subjects.

The purpose of a privacy scan is to: 

- Make a preliminary assessment of the risks of your project for data subjects.  
- Implement [Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default](#privacy-by-design) into 
your project. 
- Fulfil the principle of [Accountability](#accountability) by documenting your 
project. 
- Identify whether a full [Data Protection Impact Assessment](#dpia) (DPIA) is needed. 

### When to use a privacy scan? {#privacy-scan-when}

Whenever you use personal data in your project, we recommend to complete a 
privacy scan in consultation with your [privacy officer](#support) 
to make sure your data are well protected throughout your project. As the 
privacy scan is a planning document, much like a 
[Data Management Plan](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management/guides/data-management-planning){target="_blank"}, 
it is preferable to fill it out as **early as possible before you start 
collecting data**, to prevent unforeseen or costly changes to the design of your 
research project.  

::::note
- Treat the privacy scan as a living document: update it if anything changes 
in your design.  
- Retain the privacy scan as long as you retain personal data.
::::

Note that there is some overlap in content with some Data Management Plans and 
research protocols (e.g., that of the CCMO). The privacy aspects in a privacy 
scan are just more extensive.

## Data Protection Impact Assessment {#dpia}

::::keywords
On this page: DPIA, GBEB, risk assessment, high risk, protection measures,
safeguards    
Date of last review: 2023-02-14
::::

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is an instrument to identify and 
mitigate privacy risks associated with processing personal data in a project. 
Whereas a [privacy scan](#privacy-scan) is recommended for all projects 
processing personal data, a DPIA is required by the GDPR if your processing of 
personal data poses a [high risk](#high-risk-processing) to the rights and 
freedoms of data subjects or others 
([art. 35](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-35-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). This can be the 
case, for example, when you process personal data from vulnerable groups such 
as children or patients, sensitive personal data, or a large amount of personal 
data (see also the [risk assessment chapter](#risk-assessment)).

A DPIA is very in-depth, and requires an official advice from the university’s 
[Data Protection Officer](https://intranet.uu.nl/en/knowledgebase/data-protection-officer){target="_blank"} 
(DPO). We strongly recommend contacting your [privacy officer](#support) 
early on: they can best estimate whether a DPIA is necessary and to identify 
any approved DPIAs that may be useful for your project to reuse. And they have 
to be involved in performing the assessment anyway.

### The process of performing a DPIA {#dpia-process}

1. Contact your [privacy officer](#support) as early as possible to assess the 
necessity to carry out a DPIA. 
2. Work together with your privacy officer, and possible other stakeholders like 
security officers, to assess your [design](#privacy-by-design) and 
[risks](#risk-assessment) and complete the DPIA.
3. When finished, the DPIA will be sent to the Data Protection Officer (DPO) for 
advice. Their considerations will also need to be documented.
4. You may need to adjust your research design and update the DPIA accordingly.
5. In case of a negative DPO advice, you should ask your head of department or 
faculty dean for permission to go ahead with your project.
6. Regularly update the DPIA when there are changes in your research project.
7. Retain the DPIA for as long as you retain personal data.

## Data Transfer Impact Assessment {#dtia}

:::keywords

Date of last review: 2023-02-14
:::

A Data Transfer Impact Assessment (DTIA) is a risk analysis that is needed when 
personal data are [transferred to third countries](#third-country-transfers). 
A DTIA is not an official GDPR document by itself, like the DPIA, but instead 
is **usually part of, or a supplement to, a [DPIA](#dpia)**.

### Goal and content of a DTA {#dtia-goal}

The goal of a DTIA is to:

- assess the risks of:
  - the data receiver not being able to provide the promised level of protection.
  - local regulations preventing the removal or returning of the personal data after use.
  - local authorities accessing the personal data (il)legitimately.
- determine the appropriate safeguards to protect the data during the transfer. 

### Content of a DTIA {#dtia-content}

The DTIA [should ideally contain](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-06/edpb_recommendations_202001vo.2.0_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf){target="_blank"}: 

1. the context of the data transfer (which data are transferred, how, where?)
2. under which safeguards ([art. 46](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-46-gdpr/){target="_blank"}) 
the data will be transferred (e.g., [Standard Contractual Clauses](#scc))
3. how effective the safeguards will be ([risk analysis](#risk-assessment))
4. which additional safeguards are needed to ensure a sufficient level of data protection 
5. a final decision on whether or not the data can be transferred

As this is a relatively new topic in data protection land, please contact your 
[privacy officer](#support) for assistance with a DTIA or for questions about 
third-country transfers .

## Processing register {#processing-register}

::::

Any EU-based organisation is required to keep a registry of processing 
activities from within their organisation 
([art. 30](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
If you are performing research with human subjects, the odds are that your 
research project will have to be registered in such a register as well. Such a
register should contain who are processing the personal data, for what purpose,
which personal data are processed, with whom the data are shared, and how the 
data will be protected.

Notably, the GDPR does not prescribe what such a register should look like 
exactly, and thus every institution has their own way in which the processing 
register is implemented and managed. Ask your local [privacy officer](#support) how your
institution registers research projects that process personal data.

:::note
At Utrecht University, a university-wide processing register is currently being
developed. For the time being, other administrative systems and documents such as
the Data Management Plan, the privacy scan, the DPIA and/or the ethical 
application may function as a processing register. Please ask your
[privacy officer](#support) for more information about how your faculty handles this.

**There are many types of agreements that can – and sometimes should – be set up 
during a research project. Which one you need depends on the purpose of transfer, 
where the data are transferred to, and the external party’s role in the research 
project. The flowchart below gives an indication which agreement should be used 
in which situation. Under the figure, you can also find a short explanation 
about each individual type of agreement.**

![Flowchart to choose the correct type of agreement in research. Firstly, you do not need an agreement if you are collaborating with someone within your own institution, or if you use software of which the use is already covered by an existing agreement. Secondly, you need a non-disclosure agreement if you collaborate with someone outside of your institution who processes data within your institutional hardware. Thirdly, you need a data processing agreement when you collaborate with someone who does not have their own processing purposes and is thus a processor. You also need a data processing agreement when you use software that processes personal data on your behalf. Fourthly, you need a data transfer agreement when you collaborate with someone who wants to use your data for their own purposes, or when you use software that processes personal data for their own purposes. Finally, you need a joint controllers agreement when you collaborate with an external institution or with a software provider who has an overlapping processing purpose, such as a shared research question.](img/agreements_flowchart.png "Flowchart to choose the correct type of agreement in research")

### How to set up an agreement? {#set-up-agreements}

In order to set up an agreement, you should always get in touch with your 
[Research Support Office (RSO) or privacy officer](#support) to get the ball rolling!

:::warning
- Any agreement should be signed by someone who is authorised/mandated to do so. 
Usually this is a research director or faculty dean, but rarely you yourself. 
The RSO can tell you who in your case is mandated to sign the agreement.
- An agreement is not a replacement for consent or any other 
[legal basis](#legal-basis). It is a safeguard to make sure all 
parties involved treat the data safely and in accordance with the GDPR.
:::

### Non-disclosure agreement {#nda}

A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), or Confidentiality agreement, is an agreement 
that makes sure that either the receiver of the data or both parties handle 
data with care. Often, an NDA is meant to make sure that the receiving party 
keeps the data they get access to safe and processes the data according to 
specific guidelines. In research, it is often used between university researchers 
and students who perform research on their behalf. In this case, it is sometimes 
necessary to use an NDA, because students are not (always) bound to 
confidentiality through a contract with the university, whereas the researchers 
are.

### Data processing agreement {#data-processing-agreement}

A data processing agreement (DPA) is mandatory when you transfer personal data 
to a third party who fulfills the role of a processor 
([art. 28(3)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
In other words: a person or organisation that processes personal data on your 
behalf, without having a say as to why or how the data are processed. Important 
components of a DPA are a description of the data that are being shared, why 
they are being shared, what the third party can or cannot do with them, for how 
long, and what happens in case of a personal data breach. For example, the third 
party cannot use the data for their own purposes and is required to keep the 
data safe and report any potential data breaches to you. 

A DPA is most often used when you use an application or tool that processes 
personal data. Examples of these are survey tools, analysis tools, transcription 
tools, documentation tools and data repositories. With many parties that offer 
such tools, there is already a processing agreement in place at the UU-level, 
and so they are already safe to use, see the 
[Tooladvisor](https://tools.uu.nl/){target="_blank"}.

### Data Transfer Agreement {#data-transfer-agreement}

A data transfer agreement (DTA) is advisable when you transfer data to a third 
party who will (re)use the data for their own purposes, without having an 
active role in your research project. It is used often when this third party is 
an external institution, but is also recommended when the third party is someone 
from within your own institution. A DTA is used to ensure that both parties are 
aware of their responsibilities and are bound to do what the agreement says. It 
contains a description of the personal data that are being shared, why they are 
being shared, under which legal basis, and how the data should be protected by 
each party.

A DTA can be used when (for example):

- you want to share personal data for reuse purposes with other researchers. 
This also requires adding statements on the terms of use, although these terms 
of use can also be separately registered in a [Data Use Agreement](#user-agreement).
- you are using a software tool, and the software provider wants to run 
analytics on the personal data you process in their tool. This makes the 
software provider a controller, with a separate purpose from your own (e.g., 
answering your research question). Note that you likely already have a 
[Data Processing Agreement](#data-processing-agreement) with the 
software provider, and thus a clause in that DPA can also suffice in such cases.

<a href="https://www.uu.nl/sites/default/files/data_transfer_agreement_youth_template.pdf" target = "_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><button type="button">Example Utrecht University</button></a>

### Joint controllers agreement {#joint-controller-agreement}

A joint controllers agreement is mandatory when you work together with another 
controller on the same personal data, and you have common purposes (why) and 
means (how) of processing. In a joint controllers agreement, the respective 
responsibilities of both (all) parties are formalised, e.g., who informs data 
subjects, who is the contact point for data subjects, and how are data kept 
secure ([art. 26](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-26-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
In research, this happens most often in a consortium, where multiple institutions
participate in a research project. Therefore, a joint controllers agreement is 
often part of the consortium agreement, in which also topics other than the 
processing of personal data are formalised (e.g., intellectual property rights, 
how data are shared, etc.).

<!-- This text on the DUA may be clarified -->
### Data Use Agreement {#user-agreement}
A data use agreement (DUA), or user agreement, is basically a custom license for 
your dataset. It specifies the terms and conditions under which the receiver of 
the data can (re)use the data and is therefore in many ways similar to a 
[Data Transfer Agreement](#data-transfer-agreement). For example, 
it may contain statements on what the receiver can do with the data, and how 
the original data owners should be attributed. It can also state that the 
receiver must comply with the GDPR and cannot try to reidentify data subjects. 
DUAs are often used in data repositories (e.g., custom terms of use in 
DataverseNL) or as part of a Data Transfer Agreement, and often (but not always) 
when an open license is not suitable (e.g., with personal data).

### Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers {#scc}

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs, 
[art. 46](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-46-gdpr/){target="_blank"}) are 
model clauses that have been 
[pre-approved" by the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en){target="_blank"}
to include in agreements. They are specifically meant as a (sometimes necessary) 
safeguard when personal data are transferred to processors and controllers
outside of the EEA (i.e., [third-country transfers](#third-country-transfer)). 
This is because the SCCs contain (among others) a list of 
minimal necessary safeguards that the receiving party should implement to ensure 
that the personal data are properly protected. SCCs only have to be used in 
specific situations, and they should ideally be preceded by a 
[Data Transfer Impact Assessment](#dia) that identifies SCCs as an 
appropriate measure. Please contact your [privacy officer](#support)
if you have questions about them.

There are also SCCs for transfers to processors *within* the EEA 
([art. 28(7)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/){target="_blank"}). 
These can be included in a 
[Data Processing Agreement](#data-processing-agreement). Because they
are standardised clauses, including these can make it easier to finalise a DPA.
