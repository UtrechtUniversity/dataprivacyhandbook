# Other techniques

In addition to the techniques discussed in the previous chapters, other 
techniques exist that can help protect data subjects' privacy. Here, we discuss 
the following techniques:

- [Encryption](#encryption), for example of files, folder or entire drives.
- [Synthetic data](#synthetic-data) that does not contain data from real 
individuals, but can mimic statistical properties of the original dataset.
- [Data donation](#data-donation), in which citizens are asked to donate digital 
trace data for scientific research purposes.

Encryption is a technique to convert digital information into a code or cipher, 
which can only be read by someone who has the key to decipher or decrypt it. It 
can be applied to many digital objects, such as text strings, files, folders or 
entire storage drives. The format of the decryption key can also vary between a
password, a randomly generated code, or a file. 

For personal data, encryption can be seen as a pseudonymisation technique, where 
the encrypted data are pseudonymised and the encryption key is the additional
information needed to identify individuals. In research, encryption is often 
applied for data "at rest", that is, data that are stored and not actively used.
However, data can also be encrypted *in transit* (i.e., during transfers) or 
even *in use* (i.e., performing [computations on encrypted data](#homomorphic-encryption)).

### Types of encryption {#encryption-types}

There are several [types of encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption#Types){target="_blank"}. 
How they work can get complicated very quickly, but here is a general overview 
of the different types:

1. **Symmetric encryption**: the same key is used for both encryption and 
decryption. This is a relatively quick way to encrypt data and is most often 
used for research data. Because only one key is needed to leak the data, a 
hard-to-guess key, secure storage and secure transfer of the key is crucial. 
Example algorithms that use symmetric encryption are AES, (3)DES, Blowfish, and 
IDEA.
2. **Asymmetric encryption** (public-key): two different keys are used for 
encryption and decryption: a public key is used for encryption and can be 
shared with anyone, and a private key is used for decryption, which must be 
kept secret. This is also known as end-to-end encryption and is used in many
messaging platforms to prevent service providers from decrypting private 
messages. Example algorithms are RSA and elliptic curve cryptography.
3. **Hybrid cyphers**: hybrid cyphers combine the speed of symmetric, and the 
security of asymmetric encryption. Typically, a symmetric algorithm is used to 
encrypt the data, and an asymmetric algorithm to encrypt the symmetric key. 
This type of encryption is commonly used in secure communications, such as 
email and virtual private networks (VPNs).

:::fyi
In general, the more "bits" that are used by an encryption algorithm, the 
larger the number of possible keys is, and thus the harder it is to 
[guess the correct key](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/encryption-and-cryptography/0/steps/184663){target="_blank"} 
using a brute-force attack.
:::

### When to use {#encryption-when}

Encryption can be applied on different levels. In research, data are encrypted 
usually either on a drive-level or on file/folder level:

- **Full-drive encryption** ("volume" encryption) makes sure that data on 
storage drives or devices are not readable if someone gains unauthorised access 
to the device or drive. This is generally recommended to always apply to 
devices that contain research data, but particularly when:
  - you want to protect data on your personal laptop (encrypt the entire laptop 
  or specific hard drives).
  - you collect data on portable devices like USB sticks and audio recorders.
- Encryption of **individual files or folders** ("container" encryption) can be 
used when you need to protect individual files or folders. Use it when:
  - you cannot physically separate different types of personal data on different 
  storage locations and need to make sure that a limited number of people can 
  access the encrypted data. 
  - you have to store personal data on a non-encrypted drive that multiple 
  people have access to, which they do not need.
  - you need to send personal data to a collaborator, for example via the cloud 
  or via a file sender. 

### Implications for research {#encryption-implications}

- Encryption only guarantees protection while the data are encrypted, which is 
usually during storage or in transit. For example, encryption is generally not 
a suitable safeguard to protect data during data analysis, because usually 
data need to be decrypted in order to be read by analysis software. This implies 
that when you need to decrypt the data, other safeguards must be in place to 
protect the data, such as controlled access and a secure workspace. 
- Responsible key management is crucial. In principle, the data cannot be 
accessed without a decryption key. Although some encryption software offers the 
possibility to create recovery keys, there is still someone who needs to manage 
the key(s), as long as the data are encrypted.
- When you use file/folder encryption, please note that in some cases, folder 
and/or file names are not encrypted. If these names contain sensitive 
information, consider renaming the folders/files or putting them in a zipped 
folder with a non-sensitive name and then encrypting the zipped folder.
- Just because you encrypt data with a state-of-the-art encryption algorithm now, 
that does not mean the data are necessarily protected in the future as well. 
Encryption algorithms can become unsafe due to, for example, new technological 
developments or bugs in the encryption algorithm that make it more vulnerable 
to attacks. Therefore, if you store encrypted files for a long period of time, 
you need to regularly re-assess whether the algorithm is still secure enough 
and if needed, re-encrypt the data.

Synthetic data generation is the process of creating artificial data, which can 
be used in place of the real, possibly personal, data. Instead of simply 
adjusting an existing dataset to make it less identifiable, a completely new 
dataset is generated, with fictitious individuals. When creating synthetic data, 
sensitive values (which can be some values, or the entire dataset) in the data 
are replaced by values that are generated from a statistical model. The 
intuition behind this is to mimic the idea of drawing samples from a population. 
Not with actual people, but with fictitious individuals that "look like" the 
people from the population. Synthetic data can be created in multiple ways, 
such as based on rules or using a trained machine learning model, and for 
different purposes, such as for privacy protection purposes, but also for data 
enrichment or software testing.

### When to use {#synthetic-data-when}

Synthetic data can be generated for a variety of reasons, for example:

- As an intermediate step in sharing (personal) data, before others gain access 
to (part of) the real dataset. This can for example be useful when data 
recipients still have to determine which variables they need from the real 
dataset, or how many observations. Or when the data request procedure can take 
up a large amount of time and recipients already want to explore the (synthetic) 
data.
- To develop code without requiring access to real (personal) data. In this 
case, the synthetic data usually does not need to mirror the data statistically, 
but just in terms of the structure (e.g., only with the same column names and 
data types). Synthetic data that only resembles the real dataset in terms of 
its structure is also sometimes called "dummy data".
- To adhere to an open science workflow, to evaluate and reproduce analyses. If 
you share both a synthetic dataset and your code, others can easily evaluate 
your code with an actual dataset, see the results of the code and test its 
reproducibility.
- In teaching, to prevent having to share (personal) data with students.

### Implications for research {#synthetic-data-implications}

- Although synthetic data are artificial, privacy risks may still remain. You 
can think of it like this: if the generating model is too good, you could 
reproduce the original data exactly, doing no better in protecting anyone's 
privacy. On the other end, you can create a synthetic dataset that sets every 
value to "0", which protects privacy very well, but is useless in terms of its 
quality. Usually, the result is somewhere in between: the synthetic data is 
less informative than the real data, at the expense of leaking some information 
about the original sample (e.g., descriptive statistics, relationships between 
variables, plausible values in the data). Hence, the synthetic data lies on a 
**privacy-utility spectrum**. Whether the synthetic dataset still contains 
personal data will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis and will 
differ depending on the method used to create the synthetic dataset. For more 
detailed information on this concept of the privacy-utility spectrum, see the 
[UK Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsmethodologyworkingpaperseriesnumber16syntheticdatapilot){target="_blank"}. 
- Synthetic data is sometimes used in conjunction with 
[Differential Privacy](#differential-privacy), which can help to numerically 
set the level of privacy/utility. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to 
determine the disclosure risk directly from the synthetic data, and it is 
better to fix the privacy leakage in the process of generating the data.
- The quality of the synthetic dataset is highly dependent on the input from 
which it is created. In general, a larger number of rows in the dataset 
(individuals) results in better quality synthetic data as there is more 
variability in the dataset. Moreover, datasets that contain many outliers 
typically result in lower-quality synthetic data, because they can have a large 
influence on the statistical properties of the dataset (e.g., the mean) from 
which the synthetic dataset is created. This in turn can lead to a distorted or 
unrealistic distribution in the synthetic dataset.

## Data donation {#data-donation}

On this page: data donation, digital trace data, local processing, interactive 
consent    
Date of last review: 2023-11-24
:::

People leave all kinds of digital traces, for example on social media, 
smartphones, search engines, email, banks, energy providers, and online shops. 
[Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/){target="_blank"} of the GDPR 
mandates that individuals have the right to request access to a copy of their 
personal data collected and stored on those digital platforms. The owners of 
those platforms will then make that digital trace data available through 
individual "Data Download Packages" (DDPs). These DDPs can contain a lot of 
personal information that may be too sensitive to share, but can also be of 
high value for scientific research purposes.

The data donation approach as developed by 
[Boeschoten et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2011.09851){target="_blank"} 
allows researchers to automatically analyse the digital traces found in DDPs, 
while preserving the privacy of research participants. The workflow is as follows:

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/3bdcf4ba-3f26-474b-ac54-534ebbe4af52/gr1.jpg" 
title="Data donation workflow as defined in Boeschoten et al., 2022, 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2022.100444" alt = "Visualisation of the 
workflow. The following steps take place at the participant's device: 
1. Participant requests Data Download Package (DDP) at data controller, 
2. Participant downloads DDP to own device, 3. Participant visits PORT website, 
4. PORT extracts relevant features from the DDP locally. Step 5 takes place at 
the researcher's environment, where they perform analyses on the extracted 
features." />
</p>

1. Data subjects are recruited as respondents like in a regular research project.
2. The researcher determines which DDPs are relevant for the research question 
and writes a script to extract the relevant information. 
3. Each data subject requests their DDPs with the selected providers and stores 
these locally on their own device. 
4. Stored DDPs are then locally processed with the software 
[PORT](https://github.com/eyra/port){target="_blank"} to extract relevant 
research variables. PORT executes the script provided by the researcher and 
locally extracts the data from the DDP. PORT uses 
[Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable){target="_blank"} technology to run in 
its own secure environment which is completely separated from the device. This 
environment is destroyed as soon as the browser page is closed.
5. The data subject inspects the information resulting from the analysis and is 
asked to provide [informed consent](#informed-consent-forms) to share it with 
the researcher. 
6. If the data subject consents, the derived information is encrypted and sent 
to the researcher for further analysis. 

### When to use {#data-donation-when}

The data donation approach can be used:

- As an alternative or in addition to surveys to study human behaviour.
- To analyse data that are too sensitive to transfer in raw form.
- To allow data subjects a large degree of control over their (personal) data.
- To access data that are representative of a population of interest, in 
contrast to, for example, data retrieved from APIs, which often pertain a 
non-random subset of a platform's user group. 
- As a user-centric approach that is independent from platforms or data 
controllers: private companies cannot suddenly withdraw from a collaboration or 
restrict access to a dataset, because the data were not obtained directly 
through them. It is important, however, to review the Terms of Service of the 
platforms you use, to review if there are restrictions on data usage for 
scientific research.  

### Implications for research

- DDPs may be large and contain different types of information. For both the 
analysis (writing the script) and the informed consent (informing data subjects 
specifically), it is important that you know which specific data are of interest.
- The structure of DDPs varies by provider and by person, making it difficult 
to set up analysis scripts generically. Moreover, DDPs change over time. 
Analysis scripts should regularly be checked and updated 
([Boeschoten et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3233/DS-210035){target="_blank"}).
- Analysis scripts are usually developed based on sample data. However, due to 
the sensitive content, DDP sample data are difficult to obtain. As sample data, 
you could use your own DDP, synthetic data 
([example](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/google-semantic-location-history){target="_blank"}), 
or already available open data 
([example](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4472606){target="_blank"}). 
- It is important to make sure that data subjects understand what they are 
consenting to when presenting the results that will be shared with you (step 5). 
Do they understand the risks involved (if any)? We recommend talking to a 
[privacy officer](#support) and/or testing this among data subjects before you 
start your Data Donation project.
