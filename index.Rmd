# Data Privacy Handbook

![Illustrated cover image for the Data Privacy Handbook, showing a person sitting cross-legged with a laptop on their lap. From the laptop arise several concepts that are covered in the Data Privacy Handbook: Anonymisation (depicted as a face covered with a censor bar), Transparency (depicted as one person showing another person a checklist, informing them), Data sharing (depicted as two laptops connected to a globe), Privacy by Design (depicted as a map with a shield on it), and Personal data (depicted as a fingerprint that connects zeros and ones). The person is floating as if in meditation: happy that they achieved GDPR compliance. The left upper corner of the image shows the Utrecht University logo, and the bottom of the image says 'Data Privacy Handbook'.

## About

The Data Privacy Handbook is a practical guide on handling personal data in 
scientific research, primarily written for Utrecht University researchers and 
research support staff in the Netherlands. It is an initiative of 
[Research Data Management Support](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management){target="_blank"}, 
in collaboration with privacy and data experts at Utrecht University.

The Data Privacy Handbook consists of:

- A **knowledge base** which explains how the EU General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR, Dutch: Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming)  applies to 
scientific research, including guidelines and good practices in carrying out 
GDPR-compliant scientific research; 
- An overview of privacy-enhancing **techniques & tools** and practical guidance 
on their implementation;
- **Use Cases** in the form of research projects with privacy-related issues, 
for which a reusable solution (e.g., tool, workflow) is shared.
